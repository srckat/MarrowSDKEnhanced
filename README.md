# Marrow SDK Project Template

This project template has the Extended SDK pre-installed, along with a few other useful goodies.
**NOTE:** All packages included in this template are publicly available for free.

## Setup instructions:
**1.** Download the file that begins with **`com.unity.template.arparec-marrowsdkenhancedpubva-`** from <https://github.com/srckat/MarrowSDKEnhanced/releases/latest>.
**2.** Make sure Unity and Unity Hub are **CLOSED** before continuing (make sure you close Unity Hub from the taskbar too).
**3.** Navigate to `C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\2021.3.16f1\Editor\Data\Resources\PackageManager\ProjectTemplates` (This will be different if you installed Unity on a different drive).
**4.** Copy the package file into this folder. **DO NOT EXTRACT IT!**

## Usage instructions:
**1.** Click **New Project** in Unity Hub, and make sure the correct Unity version is selected.
**2.** Select the template named **Marrow SDK Enhanced**.
**3.** Fill out the project name and choose a path like normal (make sure the path of your project is not unnecessarily long).
**4.** Click **Create Project**

## Important Notes:
- You WILL get an error complaining that the project has compiler errors. Just click **Ignore**, as the correct packages will be imported later on.
- The project may take a while to create. When I was testing, it took about 15-20 minutes.
- You will notice that the SLZ registry is not in the project. This is because it is set up with my custom registry, which includes special versions of the SLZ packages that doesn't have weird dependency issues.
